# Component Generator

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator for themes and projects at Lost My Name.

To use:

```
npm install -g yo generator-lmn-theme
yo lmn-theme
```

## GitHub support

The generator will always create a git repository for you. You can also get it
to create a GitHub repository for you, and at this point you will be prompted
for a "Personal access token", which you can create in [Settings ->
Applications](https://github.com/settings/applications).

This will be stored, so you only need to provide it the first time. Default
permissions are fine, as long as it has either "repo" or "public_repo" access.
